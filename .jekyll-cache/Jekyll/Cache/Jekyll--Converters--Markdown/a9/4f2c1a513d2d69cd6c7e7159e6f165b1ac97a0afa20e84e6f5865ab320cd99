I"“<p>Iâ€™m excited to announce a new open-source package and an enhancement to the Swift Evolution process: the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-standard-library-preview">Standard Library Preview package</a>! The preview package provides access to functionality that has been accepted into the Swift standard library through the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md">Swift Evolution process</a>, but has not yet shipped as part of an official Swift release. This will allow us to incorporate feedback informed by real-world usage and remove many of the technical obstacles to contributing to the standard library.</p>
