I"K<p>Xcode 9 includes a brand new refactoring engine. It can transform code locally
within a single Swift source file, or globally, such as renaming a method or property
that occurs in multiple files and even different languages. The logic behind local refactorings is
implemented entirely in the compiler and SourceKit, and is now open source in
the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift">swift repository</a>. Therefore, any Swift enthusiast can
contribute refactoring actions to the language. This post discusses how
a simple refactoring can be implemented and surfaced in Xcode.</p>
