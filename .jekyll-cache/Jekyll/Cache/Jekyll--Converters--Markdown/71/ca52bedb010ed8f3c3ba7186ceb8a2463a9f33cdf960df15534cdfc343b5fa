I"N<p>We are delighted to announce a significant expansion of our Swift.org continuous integration testing system.  Members of the Swift community have been hard at work to support Swift on a number of new platforms, and we have extended the Swift CI system to support community-hosted nodes for testing additional platforms.</p>

<p>Community members can volunteer to host nodes for additional platforms and are responsible for maintaining the host system.  New nodes can be initiated by creating a pull request at: <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-community-hosted-continuous-integration">Swift Community-Hosted CI Repository</a>.  Further information about the process is documented in the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-community-hosted-continuous-integration/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a>.</p>

<p>We have worked with several members of the community and are pleased to make CI testing available today for Fedora, and ARMv7 for Debian “Stretch”. Check them out at: <a href="https://ci-external.swift.org">Community-Hosted CI</a>.</p>
