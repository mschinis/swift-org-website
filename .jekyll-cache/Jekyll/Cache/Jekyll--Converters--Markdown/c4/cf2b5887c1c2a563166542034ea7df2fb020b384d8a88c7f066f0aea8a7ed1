I" <p>The Swift 5 release enables runtime checking of â€œExclusive Access to
Memoryâ€ by default in Release builds, further enhancing Swiftâ€™s
capabilities as a safe language. In Swift 4, these runtime checks were
only enabled in Debug builds. In this post, Iâ€™ll first explain what
this change means for Swift developers before delving into why it is
essential to Swiftâ€™s strategy for safety and performance.</p>
