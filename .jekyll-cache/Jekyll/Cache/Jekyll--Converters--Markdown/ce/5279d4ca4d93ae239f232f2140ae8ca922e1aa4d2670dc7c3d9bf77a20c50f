I"Î	<p>We are excited to announce that we have rolled out <a href="https://swift.org/continuous-integration">continuous integration</a> (aka, CI) for the Swift project!</p>

<p>Our CI system is powered by <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org">Jenkins</a>.  For Apple‚Äôs platforms it builds and runs tests for macOS and the iOS simulator.  For Linux it builds and runs tests for Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 15.10 (both for x86_64).  In addition to using it for testing active branches, the CI system also produces the snapshots that are available for download from Swift.org.</p>

<p>The intent of the CI is to enable additional configurations to be added over time, especially in the cases where ports to other platforms or architectures reach a critical mass and support from the Swift development community.</p>

<p>CI is not only a powerful tool for monitoring the health of the Swift project, but can also be used as a part of reviewing changes before they land.  To facilitate this, we have <strong>integrated testing within pull requests</strong>, allowing testing to occur before commits are made and without destabilizing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch. The results will be posted inline within the pull request.  When someone makes a change that breaks a build, they will automatically be notified via email.</p>

<h3 id="testing-pull-requests">Testing Pull Requests</h3>

<p>When a change is reviewed on a pull request, a member of the community with commit access can trigger testing of the pull request by the CI system.  Tests can be triggered to run on macOS, Linux, or both platforms.</p>

<p>Testing status is then be posted inline with the pull request, showing that a test is in progress.  You can click the ‚Äúdetails‚Äù link to go directly to the status page for the test in progress.

<p>When tests complete, the result is updated in the pull request.

<p>If there are issues found during testing, you will get a link to the details of the failure.

<p>In the near future, we will also be supporting running performance tests.  We also welcome community involvement to help us expand testing to additional configurations.</p>
