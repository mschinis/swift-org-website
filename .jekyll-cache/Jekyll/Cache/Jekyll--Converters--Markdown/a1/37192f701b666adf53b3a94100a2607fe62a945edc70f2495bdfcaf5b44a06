I"Q<p>We are pleased to announce <strong>Swift 2.3</strong>!</p>

<p>Swift 2.3 is a minor update from Swift 2.2.1.  The primary difference between
Swift 2.2.1 and Swift 2.3 is that it is intended to be paired with Appleâ€™s
macOS 10.12, iOS 10, watchOS 3, and tvOS 10 SDKs.  It also updates the underlying
LLVM and Clang versions to match with those in the Swift 3 compiler.</p>
