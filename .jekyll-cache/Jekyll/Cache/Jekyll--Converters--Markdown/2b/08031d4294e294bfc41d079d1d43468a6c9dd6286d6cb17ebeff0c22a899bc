I"N<p>It is my pleasure to announce a new open source project for the Swift server ecosystem, <a href="https://github.com/swift-server/swift-service-lifecycle">Swift Service Lifecycle</a>. Service Lifecycle is a Swift package designed to help server applications, also known as services, manage their startup and shutdown sequences.</p>
