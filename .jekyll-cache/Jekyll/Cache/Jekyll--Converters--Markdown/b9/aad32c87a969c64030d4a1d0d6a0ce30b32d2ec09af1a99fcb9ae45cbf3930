I"Ú2<p>This post describes the goals, release process, and estimated schedule for Swift 4.</p>

<p>Swift 4 is a major release that is intended to be completed in the fall of 2017. It pivots around providing source stability for Swift 3 code while implementing essential feature work needed to achieve binary stability in the language.
It will contain significant enhancements to the core language and Standard Library, especially in the generics system and a revamp of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String</code> type.  More details can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution#development-major-version--swift-40">Swift Evolution page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="source-compatibility">Source Compatibility</h2>

<p>The Swift 4 compiler will provide two language modes: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-swift-version 3</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-swift-version 4</code>.</p>

<h3 id="swift-version-3-mode">Swift Version 3 Mode</h3>

<p>The first mode, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-swift-version 3</code>, is the default for existing code.  Under this mode, it is a strong goal that the vast majority of sources that built with the Swift 3.1 compiler continue to build with the Swift 4 compiler.  The exception will be bug fixes to the compiler that cause it to reject code that should never have been accepted in the first place.  These cases should be relatively rare in practice.</p>

<p>Please file <a href="https://bugs.swift.org">bug reports</a> if you encounter cases where the Swift 4 compiler unexpectedly rejects code that previously compiled with the Swift 3.1 compiler.</p>

<h3 id="swift-version-4-mode">Swift Version 4 Mode</h3>

<p>The second mode, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-swift-version 4</code>, is the mode that makes available the new and disruptive changes in the release.  Of notable importance is an <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/StringManifesto.md">overhaul of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String</code> API</a>, where a key focus is to improve the ergonomics of the API and its performance.  These changes are source-breaking, and thus will require existing code to migrate to using the new APIs.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that, from a code migration perspective, the difference between Swift 3 and Swift 4 code is expected to be much smaller than the jump from Swift 2.2 to Swift 3.</p>

<h3 id="mixing-code-with-different-language-modes">Mixing Code with Different Language Modes</h3>

<p>The intended design is that a project containing multiple Swift modules, such as an Xcode project with multiple Swift targets, will be able to adopt into the specific Swift language mode on a per module (target) level and that they can freely interact within the same compiled binary.  Note that this interoperability only exists at the binary level when the targets are compiled with the same compiler.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of what this interoperability enables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In Xcode, an application target can be writen in Swift 4 (i.e., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-swift-version 4</code>) but the project can have a separate framework target used by the application that is written in Swift 3 (i.e., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-swift-version 3</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Swift package written in Swift 4 (i.e., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-swift-version 4</code>) should be able to use existing packages that are written in Swift 3 without needing the packages to update their source code to Swift 4.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, this scheme will allow existing Swift 3 code to more gradually migrate to Swift 4 (e.g., a target or package at a time).</p>

<p>A more detailed description of the intent for source compatibility for Swift releases can be found on a <a href="https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20161128/029099.html">thread</a> on the <a href="https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution">swift-evolution</a> mailing list.</p>

<h2 id="snapshots-of-swift-4">Snapshots of Swift 4</h2>

<p>As in the case of Swift 3.1, for Swift 4 there will be daily downloadable snapshots of the release branch.  Snapshots will be produced as part of <a href="https://ci.swift.org">continuous integration</a> testing.  The cadence of downloadable snapshots will thus be more frequent and granular.  Snapshots will be posted daily, assuming tests are passing.</p>

<p>Once Swift 4 is released, official final builds will also be posted in addition to the snapshots.</p>

<h2 id="getting-changes-into-swift-4">Getting Changes into Swift 4</h2>

<p>All changes currently going into mainline development (i.e. the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch) until a final branch date is announced by the release manager, which will likely be sometime in early summer of 2017.  After that point there will be a ‚Äúbake‚Äù period in which only select, critical fixes will go into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift-4.0-branch</code> and move <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> on to developement for the next release.</p>

<h3 id="branches">Branches</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>master</strong>: With the exception of the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-llvm">swift-llvm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-clang">swift-clang</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-lldb">swift-lldb</a> repositories (see <a href="https://swift.org/blog/swift-4.0-release-process/#impacted-repositories">Impacted Repositories</a>), development of Swift 4 happens in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>.  All changes going in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> will be part of the final Swift 4 release until the final branch date.  At that point <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> tracks development for the next release.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>swift-4.0-branch</strong>: Release management for Swift 4 happens on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift-4.0-branch</code>.  All Swift 4 snapshots are built from this branch, and Swift 4 will GM from this branch as well.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Operationally, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> will be regularly merged into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift-4.0-branch</code> approximately every two weeks until the final branch date.  The two-week window provides a buffer between hot development on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> and a curated release branch.  Changes may be cherry-picked (via pull requests) into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift-4.0-branch</code> between merges of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>.</p>

<p>A notable exception to this plan is the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager">swift-package-manager</a>, which will merge from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift-4.0-branch</code> daily.</p>

<h3 id="philosophy-on-taking-changes-into-swift-4">Philosophy on Taking Changes into Swift 4</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Source compatibility with Swift 3.1 is a top priority in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-swift-version 3</code> mode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Swift 4 converges only changes that align with the core goals of the release will be considered.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All language and API changes for Swift 4 will go through the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution">Swift Evolution</a> process, with criteria for what changes are in scope for the release documented there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the release converges, the criteria for pulling changes into 4 will become increasingly restrictive.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="impacted-repositories">Impacted Repositories</h2>

<p>The following repositories will have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift-4.0-branch</code> branch to track sources as part of Swift 4 release:</p>
