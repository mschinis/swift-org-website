I"<p>Swift 2.2 brings new syntax, new features, and some deprecations too.  It is an interim release before Swift 3 comes later this year <a href="https://swift.org/blog/swift-api-transformation/">with even bigger changes</a>, and the changes in Swift 2.2 align with the broader goals of Swift 3 to focus on gradually stabilizing the core language and Standard Library by adding missing features, refining what is already there, and removing what is no longer needed in the language.  All changes in Swift 2.2 went through the community-driven <a href="https://swift.org/contributing/#participating-in-the-swift-evolution-process">Swift evolution process</a> â€” where over 30 proposals have been submitted, reviewed, and accepted since Swift was open-sourced a few months ago.</p>
