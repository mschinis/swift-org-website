I"Á<p>Swift 5.5 is now officially released!  Swift 5.5 is a massive release, which includes newly introduced language capabilities for concurrency, including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">async/await</code>, structured concurrency, and Actors.  My heartfelt thanks to the entire Swift community for all the active discussion, review, and iteration on the concurrency (and other additions) that make up the release.  Thank you!</p>
