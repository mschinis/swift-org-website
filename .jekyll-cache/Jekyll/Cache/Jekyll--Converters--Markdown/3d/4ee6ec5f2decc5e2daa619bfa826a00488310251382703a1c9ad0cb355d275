I"n<p>The <a href="https://swift.org/server/">Swift Server Work Group</a> (SSWG) set out <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/next-steps-for-the-swift-server-work-group/15816">12 months ago</a> to begin defining and prioritizing new efforts to address the needs of the Swift server community. Since then, we’ve been busy meeting regularly, working with the community, defining guidelines, writing Swift packages, voting on proposals, posting in the forums, and much more. We feel that we’ve made significant progress toward those goals we set out last year and we’d like to share a high-level update with you today.</p>
