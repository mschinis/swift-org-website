I"´<p>In June, Apple introduced Swift System, a new library for Apple platforms that provides idiomatic interfaces to system calls and low-level currency types. Today, Iâ€™m excited to announce that weâ€™re open-sourcing <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-system">System</a> and adding Linux support! Our vision is for System to eventually act as the single home for low-level system interfaces for all supported Swift platforms.</p>
