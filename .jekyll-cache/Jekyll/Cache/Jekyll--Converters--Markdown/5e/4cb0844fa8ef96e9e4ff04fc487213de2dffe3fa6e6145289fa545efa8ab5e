<h2 id="tips-for-contacting-mentors">Tips for contacting mentors</h2>

<p>The Swift forums are powered by discourse, a discussion forums platform which also has a number of spam avoidance mechanisms built-in. If this is your first time joining the forums, you <em>may</em> not be able to send mentors a direct-message, as this requires a minimum amount of prior participation before the ‚Äúsend private message‚Äù feature is automatically enabled.</p>

<p>If you would like to reach out to a mentor privately, rather than making a public forums post, and the forums are not allowing you to send private messages (yet), please reach out to Konrad Malawski at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ktoso AT apple.com</code> directly via email with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[gsoc2022]</code> tag in the email subject and describe the project you would like to work on ‚Äì and we‚Äôll route you to the appropriate mentor.</p>

<h3 id="swiftsyntax">SwiftSyntax</h3>

<h4 id="use-swiftsyntax-itself-to-generate-swiftsyntaxs-source-code">Use SwiftSyntax itself to generate SwiftSyntax‚Äôs source code</h4>

<p><strong>Project Size</strong>: Large (350 hours)</p>

<p><strong>Recommended skills</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic proficiency with Swift</li>
  <li>Python knowledge is beneficial but not necessary</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Expected difficulty</strong>: Medium</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/apple/swift-syntax">SwiftSyntax</a> heavily relies on code-generation for its syntax node definitions. These files are currently being generated using gyb, a Python-based code generation tool developed as part of the Swift compiler. SwiftSyntax itself also has code generation capabilities, which have recently been significantly improved by the introduction of <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/tree/main/Sources/SwiftSyntaxBuilder">SwiftSyntaxBuilder</a>.</p>

<p>During the Google Summer of Code project, the student will migrate the current gyb-based code generation to use SwiftSyntaxBuilder, dogfooding SwiftSyntaxBuilder inside SwiftSyntax itself. To perform the migration, the student will also make further improvements to SwiftSyntaxBuilder, with the goal of transitioning SwiftSyntaxBuilder from its current development state to be production-ready.</p>

<p><strong>Expected outcomes/benefits/deliverables</strong>:</p>

<p>Valuable real-world experience of using SwiftSyntaxBuilder and a production-ready Swift library to generate Swift code.</p>

<p><strong>Project Size</strong>: Medium (175 hours)</p>

<p><strong>Recommended skills</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic proficiency with Swift and scripting languages</li>
  <li>Proficient with RPMs, Debian packages and software packaging on Linux.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Expected difficulty</strong>: Medium</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>

<p>Installing Swift toolchain on Linux today is done by downloading tarballs, and installing the required dependencies manually. Supporting native packages like RPMs and Debian packages would make using Swift on Linux dramatically easier.  Prototype versions of such packages exist, but there is further work that needs to be done to turn them into a high quality product that the Swift community could use in production use cases.</p>

<p><strong>Expected outcomes/benefits/deliverables</strong>:</p>

<p>High quality RPMs and Debian packages that follow RPM and Debian best practices.</p>

<p><strong>Potential mentors</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Recommended skills</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic proficiency with backtrace mechanisms in C++ or other languages</li>
  <li>Optionally, some familiarity with libraries like backtrace_symbols, libbacktrace, backward-cpp etc.</li>
  <li>Basic proficiency with C++ and Swift</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Expected difficulty</strong>: Medium / Hard</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>

<p>Today, Swift does not produce backtraces when a process crashes on Linux, which could hinder users ability to troubleshoot production issues. To address the need, the Swift server workgroup has created a library which relies on private APIs and is a stop gap solution. The goal of this project is to design and prototype a high quality solution that can be integrated into the Swift runtime.</p>

<p><strong>Expected outcomes/benefits/deliverables</strong>:
Swift produces quality backtraces when a process crashes on Linux.</p>

  <li>Nice to have: Kafka experience</li>
  <li>Nice to have: experience with wrapping C APIs from Swift</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Expected difficulty</strong>: Medium</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>

<p>Kafka is a widely used distributed event streaming platform for high-performance data pipelines. Since the Swift on Server ecosystem is becoming more mature and with the recent introduction of Concurrency features in the language, we want to provide a Kafka client in Swift that allows to produce and consume messages. This client should vend native Swift APIs that leverage the new Concurrency features. Furthermore, the client should use librdkafka (https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka) and wrap its C APIs.</p>

<p><strong>Expected outcomes/benefits/deliverables</strong>:</p>

<p>Implementation of a native Swift package wrapping librdkafka that vends Swift APIs using Concurrency features.</p>

<h4 id="improving-debug-output-of-the-type-inference-algorithm">Improving Debug Output Of The Type Inference Algorithm</h4>

<p><strong>Project Size</strong>: Medium (175 hours)</p>

<p><strong>Recommended skills</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic proficiency with C++</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Expected difficulty</strong>: Medium</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>

<p>Swift‚Äôs type inference algorithm, implemented by the constraint solver, supports printing of debug information while type-checking an expression. This data in intended to help compiler developers to understand how/when/what types have been inferred, what restrictions have been applied, and what overload choices have been used in each attempt to reach a solution. Unfortunately, for a complex expression, the constraint solver would produce a lot of output which makes it very hard or sometimes impossible to work with, even for experienced compiler developers, because there were too many choices that the solver had to make and a lot of irrelevant information provided for each one of them.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to make the output of the constraint solver human friendly by including only the important information for understanding the source of each inferred type and errors that were encountered, and changing the format and presentation of the output in general and for each of its components.</p>

<p><strong>Expected outcomes/benefits/deliverables</strong>:</p>

<p>The new and improved debug output of the constraint solver which is much easier to work with for both experienced compiler developers and newcomers to the project.</p>

<h4 id="bridging-swift-error-handling-model-to-c">Bridging Swift Error Handling Model to C++</h4>

<p><strong>Project Size</strong>: Large (350 hours)</p>

<p><strong>Recommended skills</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic proficiency with Swift</li>
  <li>Basic proficiency with C++ (advanced knowledge of C++ is not required)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Expected difficulty</strong>: Medium</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>

<p>This project builds upon the ongoing open-source effort for exposing Swift APIs to C++, by adding support for exposing functions that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">throw</code> Swift errors to C++, and by providing C++ classes that let users handle Swift <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Error</code> values from C++.</p>

<p>This project has two primary aspects. At first, the participant will need to extend the C++ interface generator for a Swift module to emit C++ interfaces for Swift
functions that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">throw</code>, and a C++ class that represents Swift‚Äôs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Error</code> type. Then, the participant will need to implement a C++ exception class that wraps around
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Error</code> type, and a C++ class that resembles the proposed <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0323r4.html">std::expected class</a>, to provide error handling for clients that don‚Äôt use C++ exceptions. The participant will need to write test cases to verify the implementation. The participant will also need to interact with the Swift open-source community when working on the implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Expected outcomes/benefits/deliverables</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The participant will learn more about Swift‚Äôs error handling model, C++ error handling model, and working with an open-source compiler codebase.</li>
  <li>Enable C++ users to call Swift functions that can throw. Enable C++ users to examine error values produced by Swift.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="bridging-swift-enums-with-associated-values-to-c">Bridging Swift Enums With Associated Values to C++</h4>

<p><strong>Project Size</strong>: Medium (175 hours)</p>

<p><strong>Recommended skills</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic proficiency with Swift</li>
  <li>Basic proficiency with C++ (advanced knowledge of C++ is not required)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Expected difficulty</strong>: Medium</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>

<p>This project builds upon the ongoing open-source effort for exposing Swift APIs to C++, by adding support for exposing enumerations with associated values to C++. These enumerations are <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Enumerations.html#ID148">documented in the Swift language guide</a>.</p>

<p>The participant will need to extend the C++ interface generator for a Swift module to emit a C++ class that represents Swift enumerations with associated types. The generator will also need to be extended to emit the C++ member functions that allow the following operations in C++:</p>

<ul>
  <li>switch over the enumeration cases</li>
  <li>check if the enum is of a specific case</li>
  <li>extract the payload of the associated value of the case</li>
</ul>

<p>The participant will need to write test cases to verify the implementation. The participant will also need to interact with the Swift open-source community when working on the implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Expected outcomes/benefits/deliverables</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The participant will learn more about Swift‚Äôs enums with associated types, and working with an open-source compiler codebase.</li>
  <li>Enable C++ users to create and examine Swift enumerations with associated values.</li>
  <li>Enable C++ users to pass Swift enumerations with associated values to C++, and vice versa.</li>

<h4 id="providing-swift-overlays-for-c-standard-library-types">Providing Swift overlays for C++ standard library types</h4>

<p><strong>Project Size</strong>: Medium (175 hours)</p>

<p><strong>Skills required</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic proficiency with Swift</li>
  <li>Basic proficiency with C++ (advanced knowledge of C++ is not required)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Expected difficulty</strong>: Medium</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>

<p>Swift and C++ interoperability is an ongoing open-source initiative
that aims to make C++ APIs convenient to use from Swift (and vice versa). It‚Äôs spearheaded
by the Swift and C++ interoperability workgroup (https://forums.swift.org/g/cxx-interop-work-group, https://forums.swift.org/c/development/c-interoperability/82).
This project builds upon the ongoing effort for exposing C++ APIs to Swift,
by providing some Swift overlays for the C++ standard library types, like std::string
and std::vector.</p>

<p>The participant will need to write Swift code to provide conformances to standard Swift protocols such as Collection for several C++ standard library types, like the following ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::string</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::vector</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::map</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::set</code></li>
</ul>

<p>These conformances should be built as a separate overlay module, similar to the Darwin overlay and made available in Swift toolchains. The participant will need to modify the CMake build scripts to enable building and packaging the overlay module.
The participant will need to write test cases to verify the implementation and also need to interact with the Swift open-source community to obtain and respond to code reviews while working on the implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Expected outcomes/benefits/deliverables</strong>:</p>

<p>The participant will learn more about Swift‚Äôs type system, the Swift standard library protocols, and the C++ standard library types like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::string</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::vector</code>. The participant will also learn more about  working with an open-source compiler codebase.</p>

<p>Successful implementation of this project would enable Swift users to use certain C++ standard library types such as std::vector with APIs vended by the Swift standard library. E.g., this would enable iterating over a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::vector</code> with a Swift for-in loop or invoking a compactMap method on it.</p>
