I"ö<p>Iâ€™m thrilled to announce a new open-source project for the Swift ecosystem,
<a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-crypto">Swift Crypto</a>. Swift Crypto is a new
Swift package that brings the fantastic APIs of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cryptokit">Apple
CryptoKit</a> to the wider
Swift community. This will allow Swift developers, regardless of the platform
on which they deploy their applications, to access these APIs for a common set
of cryptographic operations.</p>
