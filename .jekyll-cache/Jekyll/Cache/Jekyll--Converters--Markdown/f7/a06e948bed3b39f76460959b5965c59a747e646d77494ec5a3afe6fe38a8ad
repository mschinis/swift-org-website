I"¢<p>The Swift.org site has long served as the hub where developers come together to work on the open source Swift compiler, libraries, and tools.
Today, we are happy to announce that the Swift.org website itself is also an open source project, ready for community contributions.
With this move, the website is also expanding its mandate to better support the entire community of Swift users, not just contributors.</p>
