I"u)<p>This post describes the goals, release process, and estimated schedule for
<strong>Swift 5.0</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="motivation-and-goals">Motivation and Goals</h2>

<p>The primary goal of Swift 5.0 is for the language to
<a href="https://swift.org/abi-stability/">achieve ABI stability</a>.  This will enable a stable Swift
runtime to be deployed by OS vendors that can be linked against by executables
and libraries.</p>

<p>Related to ABI stability, <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/plan-for-module-stability/14551">module stability</a>
will be a primary focal point as well.  This will
land in either the Swift 5.0 release or in a subsequent 5.x release
depending on its readiness.</p>

<h2 id="binary-compatibility">Binary Compatibility</h2>

<p>Swift 5.0 is not binary compatible with earlier Swift releases.  Binary
compatibility allows Swift code compiled by different Swift compilers to
link together and interoperate at a runtime level.</p>

<p>However, future Swift releases will be binary compatible with Swift 5.</p>

<h2 id="source-compatibility">Source Compatibility</h2>

<p>As with Swift 4.2, the vast majority of sources that built with the Swift 4.2
compiler should compile with the Swift 5.0 compiler.</p>

<p>However, the Swift 3 compatibility mode will not be supported in the Swift 5
compiler.  Swift 4.2 is the last release of Swift to support Swift 3 mode.
There are important changes to both the surface of the language and the
interior of its implementation in the releases following Swift 3 that will be
the basis of future (and lasting) source and binary stability.</p>

<h2 id="snapshots-of-swift-50">Snapshots of Swift 5.0</h2>

<p>Downloadable snapshots of the Swift 5.0 release branch will be posted
regularly as part of <a href="https://ci.swift.org">continuous integration</a> testing.</p>

<p>Once Swift 5.0 is released, the official final builds will also be posted in
addition to the snapshots.</p>

<h2 id="getting-changes-into-swift-50">Getting Changes into Swift 5.0</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift-5.0-branch</code> contains the changes that will be released in Swift
5.0.  The branch will be managed as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift-5.0-branch</code> has already been initially cut from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Periodically, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> development branch will be merged into
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift-5.0-branch</code> until the final branch date.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>November 16, 2018 (final branching)</strong>: The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift-5.0-branch</code> will have
changes merged from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> one last time.  After the final branch date
there will be a “bake” period in which only select, critical fixes will go
into the release (via pull requests).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Five notable exceptions to this plan are <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager">swift-package-manager</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-llbuild">swift-llbuild</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation">swift-corelibs-foundation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest">swift-corelibs-xctest</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch">swift-corelibs-libdispatch</a> which
will merge from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift-5.0-branch</code> daily and whose final cutoff
date for changes will extend beyond November 16 and will be announced later.</p>

<h3 id="philosophy-on-taking-changes-into-swift-50">Philosophy on Taking Changes into Swift 5.0</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All language and API changes for Swift 5.0 will go through the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution">Swift
Evolution</a> process, with criteria
for what changes are in scope for the release documented there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other changes (e.g., bug fixes, diagnostic improvements, SourceKit interface
improvements) will be accepted based on their risk and impact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Low-risk test tweaks will also be accepted late into the release branch if
it aids in the qualification of the release.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the release converges, the criteria for accepted changes will become
increasingly restrictive.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="impacted-repositories">Impacted Repositories</h2>
