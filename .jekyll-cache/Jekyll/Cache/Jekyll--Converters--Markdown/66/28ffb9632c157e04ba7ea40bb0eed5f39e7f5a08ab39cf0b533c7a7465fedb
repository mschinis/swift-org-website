<h2 id="governance">Governance</h2>

<p>The website has a small list of <em>maintainers</em> which have <em>write</em> access and are in charge of reviewing and merging pull requests from <em>contributors</em>.
The <em>maintainers</em> group consists of a small subset of the Swift core team and the <a href="/website-workgroup">Swift website workgroup members</a>.</p>

<p>The Swift.org website source code consists of several distinct parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>General content: Markdown, HTML, data files, images and other content.</li>
  <li>Blog posts: Source files for blog posts, mostly in markdown form.</li>
  <li>Technical infrastructure: Code and scripts for generating the websiteâ€™s final static content (HTML mostly) from other forms of textual content such as Markdown and HTML files.</li>
  <li>Information design, user experience and user interface design: The layout and navigation of the website, including CSS and images used to define the user experience and user interface.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each one of these areas is governed by a slightly different contribution process that matches their nature.</p>

<p>See <a href="/website-governance">Swift.org governance</a> for additional information about the websiteâ€™s governance.</p>
