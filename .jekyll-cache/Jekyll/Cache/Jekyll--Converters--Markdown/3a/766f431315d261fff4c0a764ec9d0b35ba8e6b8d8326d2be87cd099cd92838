I""'<p>This post describes the goals, release process, and estimated schedule for
<strong>Swift 4.2</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="motivation-and-goals">Motivation and Goals</h2>

<p>Swift 4.2 is meant to be a waypoint towards achieving ABI stability in Swift
5.</p>

<p>Swift 4.2 will include numerous under-the-hood ABI changes as part of the
effort to <a href="https://swift.org/abi-stability/">stabilize the Swift ABI</a>.  It is
valuable to incrementally roll out ABI changes — many of which are performance
related — to provide ample time for user feedback in assessing these changes
before they are locked into the final ABI.</p>

<p>Swift 4.2 will also include numerous bug fixes, as well as have a goal of some
focused improvements on compile-time performance.</p>

<h2 id="binary-compatibility">Binary Compatibility</h2>

<p>Swift 4.2 is not binary compatible with previous Swift releases.</p>

<h2 id="source-compatibility">Source Compatibility</h2>

<p>As with Swift 4.1, the vast majority of sources that built with the Swift 4.0
compiler (including those using the Swift 3 compatibility mode) should compile
with the Swift 4.2 compiler.</p>

<p>There will be some exceptional cases where this cannot be an absolute
guarantee.  This includes fixes to incorrect behavior in the compiler or
corner cases with the uses of generics now addressed by the introduction of
long-anticipated generics features.  The expectation, however, is that most
projects will continue to build with no source changes.</p>

<h2 id="snapshots-of-swift-42">Snapshots of Swift 4.2</h2>

<p>Downloadable snapshots of the Swift 4.2 release branch will be posted
regularly as part of <a href="https://ci.swift.org">continuous integration</a> testing.</p>

<p>Once Swift 4.2 is released, the official final builds will also be posted in
addition to the snapshots.</p>

<h2 id="getting-changes-into-swift-42">Getting Changes into Swift 4.2</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift-4.2-branch</code> contains the changes that will be released in Swift
4.2.  The branch will be managed as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Imminently</strong>: The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift-4.2-branch</code> will be initially cut from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>.</li>
  <li>Approximately every two weeks, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> will be merged into
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift-4.2-branch</code> until the final branch date.</li>
  <li><strong>April 20, 2018 (final branching)</strong>: The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift-4.2-branch</code> will have
changes merged from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> one last time.  After the final branch date
there will be a “bake” period in which only select, critical fixes will go
into the release (via pull requests).</li>
</ul>

<p>Four notable exceptions to this plan are <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager">swift-package-manager</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-llbuild">swift-llbuild</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation">swift-corelibs-foundation</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch">swift-corelibs-libdispatch</a> which
will merge from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift-4.2-branch</code> daily and whose final cutoff
date for changes will extend beyond April 20 and will be announced later.</p>

<h3 id="philosophy-on-taking-changes-into-swift-42">Philosophy on Taking Changes into Swift 4.2</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All language and API changes for Swift 4.2 will go through the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution">Swift
Evolution</a> process, with criteria
for what changes are in scope for the release documented there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other changes (e.g., bug fixes, diagnostic improvements, SourceKit interface
improvements) will be accepted based on their risk and impact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Low-risk test tweaks will also be accepted late into the release branch if
it aids in the qualification of the release.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the release converges, the criteria for accepted changes will become
increasingly restrictive.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="impacted-repositories">Impacted Repositories</h2>

made.  This can be brief, but it should be clear.</p>
  </li>

    <p><strong>Scope</strong>: An assessment of the impact/importance of the change. For
example, is the change a source-breaking language change, etc.</p>
  </li>
