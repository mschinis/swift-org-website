I"˜<p>It is my pleasure to announce a new open source project for the Swift Server ecosystem, <a href="https://github.com/swift-server/swift-aws-lambda-runtime/">Swift AWS Lambda Runtime</a>. Distributed as a Swift package, the Swift AWS Lambda Runtime is designed to help Swift developers build serverless functions for the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Amazon Web Services Lambda platform</a>.</p>
