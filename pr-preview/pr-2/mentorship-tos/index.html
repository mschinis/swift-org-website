  </header>

  <p>Participants in the Swift Mentorship Program (the <strong>“Program”</strong>) shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth below (the <strong>“Agreement”</strong>). This is a legal agreement between you and Apple so please read it carefully before joining the Program. By submitting a survey and joining the Program, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, then you may not join the Program and participate as a Mentor or a Mentee.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Definitions</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>“Mentor”</strong> means (i) you are a member of the Swift Community; and (ii) you have agreed to provide mentorship through the Program.</p>

<p><strong>“Mentee”</strong> means (i) you are a member of the Swift Community; and (ii) you have asked to be mentored through the Program.</p>

<p><strong>“Participants,” “You”, or “Your”</strong> means both Mentors and Mentees entering into this Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>“Swift Community”</strong> means the community of Swift users more fully described at <a href="https://swift.org/community/">https://swift.org/community/</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Eligibility Requirements.</strong> All survey submissions must be submitted through the Swift Forums and will not be accepted through any other channel.

When discussing matters or sharing information while engaging in the Program, both parties are bound by the obligations set forth herein including confidentiality. Failure to comply with these Agreement terms may result in termination from the Program. The Mentor and Mentee will disclose any conflict of interest or any potential conflict of interest, as soon as such conflict of interest arises. A conflict of interest is a matter in which the interests of a Mentor or Mentee conflicts with the duty to act in the best interest of their Mentee or Mentor or to act to the detriment of their Mentee or Mentor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Participant Provisions.</strong>  (a) Participation in the Program is voluntary. You understand and agree that nothing in this Agreement may be construed as an offer or contract of employment with Apple.

Mentors and Mentees may also be asked to provide personal data to other participants who wish to be matched with them as a Mentor or Mentee. Data collected pursuant to this Agreement will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement and which can be viewed at: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</a>.</p>

You must not use any personal data about a Mentor or Mentee for any purpose (including, but not limited to, their email address or phone number) not related to the Program. Although the Mentors and Mentees agree to maintain the confidentiality of all information shared within the mentoring partnership, as the Mentors and Mentees may not be affiliated with Apple, Apple cannot guarantee that any information you disclose to your Mentor or Mentee (as applicable) will be kept confidential by the recipient.</p>

  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li><strong>Governing Law.</strong> You expressly agree that the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law rules, govern the Agreement and your participation in the Program, and that the exclusive jurisdiction for any proceeding relating in any way to your participation will be the Northern District of California. You hereby waive the right to object to the foregoing choice of law, personal jurisdiction or venue.</li>
